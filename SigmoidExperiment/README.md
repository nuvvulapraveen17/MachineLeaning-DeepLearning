In this repository I have implemented Sigmoid Class with both cross entropy loss and Mean squared error
## **Task:** Performed Simple Numerical Experiment to better understand how Sigmoid functions.<br>
**Assumption:** If the y(label) >= threshold value binarise it. <br>

We only have 2 classes(binary classification){0, 1}, so we can apply Sigmoid function to it.<br>
