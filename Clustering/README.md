In this repository I have implemented Kmeans Class in Python on mall_customers.csv data set

## **Task:** To cluster the data points based on Annual income and Spending Score

The data set mall_customers.csv file which is taken from kaggle<br>
I have only considered 2 features from data set to cluster for which we can apply Kmeans algorithm<br>
