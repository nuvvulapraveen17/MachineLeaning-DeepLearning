**Task:** To predict whether the user likes the mobile phone or not.<br>
**Assumption:** If the average rating of a mobile >= threshold value, then the user likes it, otherwise not.<br>
We have data set mobile_cleaned.csv file which is taken from www.91mobiles.com<br>
We only have 2 classes(binary classification){0, 1} we can apply Sigmoid function to it.<br>
In this repository I have implemented Sigmoid Class in Python
