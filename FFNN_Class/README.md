In this repository I have implemented Genaralized Feed Forward Neural Network for Multi Class Classification in Python.

## **Task:** Multi Class Classification. <br>

**Things to keep in Mind:** At all layers we have used only sigmoid as activation function.<br>
No batch norm, only gradient descent, not Vectorized version.
